Once a user finds a church, they are given the phone number, address, and website link to ensure they have all the information they need.

###### About the Developer
I am a front-end engineer driven to change the world through my passion for technology. I believe putting data into the hands of the consumer is the best way for technology to serve our communities. Life is about those we live amongst anyway, so why not empower each and every one of them? The roam app is helping empower its users by providing accurate church information, I plan on developing this application for all religions and adding a filter functionality. I will also be working with Uber to allow users to call for a ride if they do not have a means of transportation.

The roam app has dreams of sponsoring religious events, and donating profits to building places of worship in underdeveloped countries. Hope you enjoy and feel free to contribute yourself, I would love to hear your ideas!
